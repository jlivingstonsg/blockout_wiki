## Blockout!

Blockout is a 3D Block dropping game, that greatly exercises the 3d spatial capabilities of the human brain. The Original Blockout is in fact a subgame of the board game QUINTILLIONS and Super Quintillions, an invention of Kate Jones from http://www.gamepuzzles.com .

Super Quintillions features the block shapes you very well know from Blockout. Originally, Blockout was a 2 player game played with the quintillion pieces. The target of the game was to place your own pieces and to “block-out” placement of the opponents pieces.

In 1989, Blockout was designed as a Computer Video game by Aleksander Ustaszewski and Mirosław Zabłocki. Several Version for different Platforms were released. Among them are the widely known DOS, Atari and Amiga versions, developed by California Dreams, a subsidiary of LDW (Logical Design Works) Software, a California company (San José, actually almost all development was done in Poland, they might have an office in California only…).
